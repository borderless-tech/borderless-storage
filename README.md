# Borderless-Storage ‚Äî Minimal S3-style Object Store

A tiny, production-ready object storage server written in Rust. It exposes an S3-like model (objects identified by UUIDs, pre-signed uploads/downloads), 
persists data on the local filesystem, and includes an automatic janitor for cleaning up failed uploads.

> Ô∏è**Platform:** Uses Unix signal handling via `tokio::signal::unix`, so it currently targets Linux/macOS and other Unix-like systems.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Pre-signed URL flow** using HMAC-SHA256 (signature and expiry check, constant-time compare)
* **Clean API** all errors and responses are uniformly json, data upload and download uses http-streams for performance
* **Chunked uploads** with server-side merge and crash‚Äësafe temp files
* **Automatic cleanup** of orphaned `.tmp` files and stale chunk directories
* **Configurable limits** (request size caps, request timeout, TTL for orphans)
* **Graceful shutdown** on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`
* **Structured logging** with latency measurement and request-ids

## üöÄ Quickstart

You can use the `run.sh` to run the service locally in develop mode. See section building, deploying and configuration for more advanced options.

The actions are similar to s3, so before you can upload or download anything, you have to generate a presigned url via the `/presign` endpoint.
Assuming you have your server locally available, it would look something like this:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:3000/presign \
    -H "authorization: Bearer secret-api-key" \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "action": "upload" }'
```

This will produce a response like this:

``` json
{
  "success": true,
  "action": "upload",
  "blob_id": "01996168-e738-7552-9662-2041482b96c3",
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/upload/01996168-e738-7552-9662-2041482b96c3?expires=1758276788&sig=BDtmjKQ2iImF5emvbyqPdivEojq60UI6gYuKDRQBSO4=",
  "method": "POST",
  "expires_in": 900
}
```

You can now use the pre-signed url to upload your data (which will be stored under the given `blob_id`):


```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/upload/01996168-e738-7552-9662-2041482b96c3?expires=1758276788&sig=BDtmjKQ2iImF5emvbyqPdivEojq60UI6gYuKDRQBSO4=" \
    --data-binary @My_Fancy_File.pdf
```

Note: The data is not encoded via JSON or anything, instead the raw data is streamed over to the storage server in the body.
Internally, we use the http stream to directly write the blob to disk, without copying the entire content of the file into RAM.
This process is very efficient and allows for quick and fast uploads, even with large files.

The response of an upload returns the number of bytes written and blob-id:

``` json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "uploaded blob",
  "blob_id": "01996168-e738-7552-9662-2041482b96c3",
  "bytes_written": 714300
}
```

To retrive the data, you have to presign a download url, and then you can download the file:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:3000/presign \
    -H "authorization: Bearer secret-api-key" \
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "action": "download", "blob_id": "01996168-e738-7552-9662-2041482b96c3" }'
    
# The response looks identical to the upload response - the most important path is the presigned url, which you need to download:
curl "http://localhost:3000/files/01996168-e738-7552-9662-2041482b96c3?expires=1758277521&sig=QjRyPQUAQ9QwtKGiKg_4oUwK3QiuL3_X13UXiKs86W8=" -o My_Fancy_File.pdf
```


## üèó Build & Deploy

### Manual build

You can build this project manually like any rust project:

#### Prerequisites

* Rust 1.75+ (stable) and Cargo
* A Unix-like OS (Linux/macOS)
* A writable data directory (e.g. `/var/lib/storage`)

#### Build & run

```bash
# 1) Build
cargo build --release

# 2) Prepare data dir
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/storage
sudo chown "$USER" /var/lib/storage

# 3) Run (choose one of the config methods)
./target/release/nectarfs --ip-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 --data-dir /var/lib/storage --domain https://storage.example.com
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure borderless-storage via **(1) config file**, **(2) CLI flags**, or **(3) environment variables**. The precedence is:

1. `--config <file>` (TOML)
2. CLI flags (when *all* required are present)
3. Environment variables

### Required settings

* **IP address** and port to bind: e.g. `0.0.0.0:8080`
* **Data directory**: existing, writable path
* **Domain**: full origin used to mint pre-signed URLs (e.g. `https://storage.example.com`)

### Configuration keys & defaults

| Key                   | Env var               | Default                | Notes                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `ip_addr`             | `IP_ADDR`             | ‚Äî (required)           | Must parse as socket address       |
| `data_dir`            | `DATA_DIR`            | ‚Äî (required)           | Directory must exist & be writable |
| `domain`              | `DOMAIN`              | ‚Äî (required)           | Parsed as `http::Uri`              |
| `ttl_orphan_secs`     | `TTL_ORPHAN_SECS`     | `43200` (12h)          | Orphan TTL for temp files/chunks   |
| `max_data_rq_size`    | `MAX_DATA_RQ_SIZE`    | `4 * 1024^3` (4‚ÄØGiB)   | Hard cap for data API requests     |
| `max_presign_rq_size` | `MAX_PRESIGN_RQ_SIZE` | `100 * 1024` (100‚ÄØKiB) | Hard cap for pre‚Äësign endpoints    |
| `rq_timeout_secs`     | `RQ_TIMEOUT_SECS`     | `30` seconds           | Per‚Äërequest timeout                |

> The server validates the data directory is writable by creating and removing a small probe file.

### Example: `config.toml`

```toml
ip_addr = "0.0.0.0:8080"
data_dir = "/var/lib/nectarfs"
domain = "https://storage.example.com"
ttl_orphan_secs = 43200
max_data_rq_size = 4294967296     # 4 GiB
max_presign_rq_size = 102400      # 100 KiB
rq_timeout_secs = 30
```

### CLI flags

```
borderless-storage \
  --ip-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --data-dir /var/lib/nectarfs \
  --domain https://storage.example.com \
  --verbose
```

Or with config file:

```
borderless-storage --config ./config.toml
```

### Environment variables

```
export IP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080
export DATA_DIR=/var/lib/nectarfs
export DOMAIN=https://storage.example.com
# optional
export TTL_ORPHAN_SECS=43200
export MAX_DATA_RQ_SIZE=4294967296
export MAX_PRESIGN_RQ_SIZE=102400
export RQ_TIMEOUT_SECS=30
borderless-storage
```

### Logging

* Default log level: `INFO`
* Use `--verbose` for `DEBUG` level with extra details during cleanup and chunk checks


## üîé Implementation Notes

* **Constant‚Äëtime compare** for signatures via `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` to mitigate timing attacks
* **Atomic writes**: single‚Äëpart uploads write to `*.tmp`, then `rename` to the final path
* **Chunk verification**: `check_chunks` ensures all `chunk_{i}_{total}` exist before merge
* **Filesystem sanity**: data directory probed for writability on startup

---

## üîê Security Considerations

* Keep your HMAC secret **out of source control** and rotate when appropriate
* Set tight `rq_timeout_secs` and request size caps (`max_*`) to protect resources
* Serve over HTTPS in production; set `domain` to an HTTPS origin
* Consider placing this service behind an authenticating proxy and rate limiter

---

## üìà Performance Tips

* Put the data directory on fast storage (NVMe)
* Tune the janitor TTL and cadence for your workload
* Consider mounting the data directory on a network filesystem only if it provides strong POSIX semantics
